# Discord_Bot
This is a Discord Bot I've started making really recently. This bot is still in the making and it will take a while to finish this. This bot is mainly for gaming and is still in it's beginning stages. If you plan to use this code, you will have to generate your own bot token since mine is an environment variable to prevent others from seeing it. I would recommend linking it to Uptime Robot so this can stay online the whole time. This is because though I have a web server set up, it only lasts for one hour before it goes offline. Remember that this bot must be coded on replit.com.
